# Note: DNS records (aws_route53_record) are not created in this module.
# They should be created in the root module or a separate module, depending on the specific needs of the application.
# This is because the records often depend on resources created in other modules (e.g., load balancers, CloudFront distributions).

# Example of how to create a DNS record (commented out):
# resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
#   zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
#   name    = "example.${var.domain_name}"
#   type    = "A"
#   alias {
#     name                   = "dualstack.my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

This Terraform module creates an AWS Route 53 hosted zone for the Mint Replica application. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We define the required AWS provider.
2. We create an `aws_route53_zone` resource for the main domain.
3. We define two variables: `domain_name` and `environment`.
4. We output the `hosted_zone_id` and `name_servers` for use in other modules or the root module.

Note that we haven't created any DNS records (`aws_route53_record`) in this module. This is because DNS records often depend on resources created in other modules (like load balancers or CloudFront distributions). It's usually better to create these records in the root module or a separate module where all the necessary information is available.

I've included a commented-out example of how to create a DNS record, which can be uncommented and modified as needed in the appropriate module.

Lastly, here are the human tasks listed in the JSON specification, added as comments:

```
# Human tasks:
# TODO: Verify and update the domain name variable with the actual domain for the Mint Replica application
# TODO: Ensure that the AWS account has the necessary permissions to manage Route 53 resources
