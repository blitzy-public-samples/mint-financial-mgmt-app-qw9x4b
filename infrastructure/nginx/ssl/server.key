# DO NOT GENERATE OR STORE THE ACTUAL PRIVATE KEY IN VERSION CONTROL.

# Instructions for generating and managing the private key:

# 1. Generate a secure private key using OpenSSL:
#    openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

# 2. Set correct permissions:
#    chmod 600 server.key

# 3. Ensure only authorized personnel have access to this file.

# 4. Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for storing the private key in high-security environments.

# 5. Implement a secure key management process, including key rotation and backup procedures.

# 6. If using a passphrase, securely store the passphrase and implement a process for providing it to Nginx on startup.

# IMPORTANT: Keep this file readable only by the root user and the Nginx process.
# Never share or transmit this private key over insecure channels.
# Regularly audit access to this file and monitor for any unauthorized access attempts.

# Placeholder for the actual private key content:
# -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
# (Your private key content would go here)
# -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
