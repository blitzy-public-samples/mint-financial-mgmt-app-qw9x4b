# Human Tasks:
# 1. Review and adjust minReplicas and maxReplicas based on expected load and cost considerations (Required)
# 2. Consider adding memory-based scaling metric if applicable (Optional)
# 3. Ensure the backend deployment has resource requests set for CPU (Critical)
# 4. Monitor HPA behavior in production and fine-tune targetAverageUtilization if necessary (Required)
