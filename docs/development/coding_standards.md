# Mint Replica Coding Standards

## Introduction

This document defines the coding standards and best practices to be followed by all developers working on the Mint Replica project. Adhering to these standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

## General Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for all JavaScript-based components (backend, frontend, mobile)
2. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
3. Write self-documenting code with clear and descriptive names
4. Keep functions small and focused on a single task
5. Use meaningful commit messages following the conventional commits specification

## Code Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting. The configuration file is located at `.prettierrc` with the following rules:

- Single quotes for strings
- 2 space indentation
- No semicolons
- Trailing commas in multi-line structures

## Linting

We use ESLint for linting. The configuration file is located at `.eslintrc.js` with the following rules:

- Use the Airbnb style guide as a base
- Enable TypeScript-specific rules
- Enforce consistent import ordering

## Backend Standards

Framework: Express.js with TypeScript

Guidelines:
1. Use dependency injection for better testability
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Use async/await for asynchronous operations
4. Follow RESTful API design principles
5. Implement input validation using a library like Joi or class-validator

## Frontend Standards

Framework: React with TypeScript

Guidelines:
1. Use functional components and hooks
2. Implement proper state management using Redux
3. Use CSS-in-JS solution (styled-components) for component styling
4. Ensure responsive design for all components
5. Write unit tests for all components and utility functions

## Mobile Standards

Framework: React Native with TypeScript

Guidelines:
1. Share code with web frontend where possible
2. Use platform-specific components when necessary for better UX
3. Implement proper navigation using React Navigation
4. Ensure accessibility features are implemented
5. Optimize performance for mobile devices

## Database Standards

### PostgreSQL
1. Use migrations for all schema changes
2. Follow naming conventions for tables, columns, and indexes
3. Implement proper indexing for performance
4. Use transactions for data integrity

### MongoDB
1. Design schemas with proper data types and validation
2. Use indexing for frequently queried fields
3. Implement data pagination for large collections

## Testing Standards

Guidelines:
1. Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%)
2. Write unit tests for all business logic
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Use snapshot testing for UI components
5. Perform end-to-end testing for critical user flows

Tools:
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Security Standards

1. Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. Use HTTPS for all communications
3. Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
5. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
6. Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for vulnerabilities

## Code Review Process

Steps:
1. Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
2. Assign at least two reviewers
3. Address all comments and suggestions
4. Ensure all tests pass before merging
5. Squash commits before merging to main branch

## Documentation Standards

1. Use JSDoc for documenting functions and classes
2. Maintain up-to-date README files for each major component
3. Document all API endpoints using OpenAPI (Swagger) specification
4. Keep architecture and design documents current
