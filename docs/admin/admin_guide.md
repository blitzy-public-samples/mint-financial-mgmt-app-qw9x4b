## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Mint Replica Admin Guide. This comprehensive document provides detailed information on system management, maintenance, and troubleshooting for administrators of the Mint Replica application. The Mint Replica is a sophisticated personal financial management platform designed to empower users with full control over their financial lives.

## 2. System Architecture

The Mint Replica application is built using modern web and mobile technologies to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices. The system architecture consists of the following key components:

1. User Interface Layer:
   - Web Application (React)
   - Mobile Application (React Native for iOS and Android)

2. Application Layer:
   - Backend Server (Node.js with Express)
   - API Gateway (AWS API Gateway or Google Cloud Endpoints)

3. Data Layer:
   - Relational Database (PostgreSQL)
   - Document Database (MongoDB)
   - Caching Layer (Redis)

4. External Integrations:
   - Financial Data Aggregation Service (e.g., Plaid or Yodlee)
   - Credit Score Services
   - Investment Data Providers

5. Security and Authentication:
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - OAuth 2.0 and JWT for API authentication

6. Analytics and Insights:
   - Machine Learning models for transaction categorization and financial insights
   - Real-time data processing for up-to-date financial information

### 2.1 Data Flow

For a detailed understanding of the data flow within the Mint Replica system, please refer to the [Data Flow Document](../architecture/data_flow.md).

### 2.2 Security Architecture

An overview of the security measures implemented in the system can be found in the [Security Architecture Document](../architecture/security.md).

## 3. User Management

To manage user accounts, roles, and permissions within the Mint Replica application:

1. Access the admin dashboard at `https://admin.mintreplica.com`
2. Navigate to the "User Management" section
3. Here you can:
   - View all user accounts
   - Create new user accounts
   - Edit existing user information
   - Manage user roles (e.g., standard user, premium user, admin)
   - Reset user passwords
   - Disable or delete user accounts

Ensure that you follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions.

## 4. System Configuration

To configure various aspects of the system:

1. Environment Variables:
   - Located in `.env` files in each service directory
   - Use `.env.example` as a template for required variables
   - Ensure sensitive information is properly secured and not committed to version control

2. Feature Flags:
   - Managed through the admin dashboard
   - Navigate to "System Configuration" > "Feature Flags"
   - Toggle features on/off as needed for gradual rollouts or A/B testing

3. Integration Settings:
   - Configure external service integrations in the admin dashboard
   - Navigate to "System Configuration" > "Integrations"
   - Set up API keys, endpoints, and other necessary parameters for each integration

## 5. Database Administration

### 5.1 Backup and Restore

Regular backups are crucial for data integrity and disaster recovery. To perform backups:

1. PostgreSQL:
   - Use the `pg_dump` utility for logical backups
   - Set up continuous archiving and point-in-time recovery (PITR) for larger datasets

2. MongoDB:
   - Use `mongodump` for binary backups
   - Consider using MongoDB Atlas for managed backups if using cloud deployment

3. Redis:
   - Configure Redis persistence (AOF or RDB snapshots)
   - Use `redis-cli` to create backups

To restore from backups:

1. PostgreSQL: Use `pg_restore` for logical backups or configure PITR recovery
2. MongoDB: Use `mongorestore` to restore from binary backups
3. Redis: Use `redis-cli` to restore from RDB files or replay AOF files

### 5.2 Performance Tuning

To optimize database performance:

1. PostgreSQL:
   - Regularly run `ANALYZE` to update statistics
   - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries
   - Implement appropriate indexes based on query patterns
   - Configure `work_mem` and `shared_buffers` based on available system resources

2. MongoDB:
   - Use the MongoDB Compass to analyze query performance
   - Create appropriate indexes for frequently used queries
   - Consider using aggregation pipelines for complex queries

3. Redis:
   - Monitor memory usage and consider enabling `maxmemory` with an appropriate eviction policy
   - Use pipelining and batching for bulk operations

## 6. Deployment and Updates

For a detailed guide on deploying updates to the Mint Replica application, refer to the [Deployment Process Document](../deployment/deployment_process.md).

### 6.1 Rollback Procedures

In case of issues with a deployment, follow the procedures outlined in the [Rollback Procedure Document](../deployment/rollback_procedure.md).

## 7. Monitoring and Alerting

For comprehensive information on monitoring the health and performance of the Mint Replica application, refer to the [Monitoring Documentation](../maintenance/monitoring.md).

### 7.1 Key Performance Indicators

Monitor the following critical KPIs:

1. System Health:
   - CPU, memory, and disk usage
   - Application response times
   - Error rates and types

2. User Engagement:
   - Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
   - User session duration
   - Feature usage statistics

3. Financial Data:
   - Number of connected accounts
   - Transaction volume and frequency
   - Budget adherence rates

4. Performance:
   - API response times
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit rates

### 7.2 Alert Management

1. Set up alerts for critical system events and threshold breaches
2. Configure notification channels (email, SMS, Slack) for different severity levels
3. Implement an on-call rotation for addressing critical alerts
4. Regularly review and update alert thresholds based on system behavior and growth

## 8. Security Management
