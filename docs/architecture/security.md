## 1. Introduction

The security architecture of the Mint Replica application is designed with the primary objective of protecting user financial data and ensuring the integrity of the system. This document provides an overview of the security principles and measures implemented throughout the application's infrastructure, development process, and operational procedures.

Key security principles guiding our architecture:
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by design
- Regular security assessments and updates
- Compliance with financial industry regulations

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implemented for all user accounts
- Supports SMS, email, and authenticator app options
- Required for high-risk actions (e.g., changing account settings, large transactions)

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
- Used for secure authorization with third-party services
- Implements the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for mobile and single-page applications
- Refresh token rotation for enhanced security

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Granular access control for different user roles (e.g., standard user, premium user, admin)
- Regularly audited and updated role permissions
- Principle of least privilege applied to all user and system accounts

## 3. Data Encryption

### Encryption at Rest
- AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- Database-level encryption for PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Encrypted backups with separate key management

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 enforced for all network communications
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) implemented
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications

### Field-Level Encryption
- Additional encryption for highly sensitive data (e.g., social security numbers, account numbers)
- Separate encryption keys for each data classification level

## 4. Network Security

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implemented to protect against common web exploits
- Regular rule updates and monitoring

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Configuration
- Isolated network environments for different application tiers
- Strict security group rules limiting inbound and outbound traffic

### Network Segmentation
- Separation of web, application, and database tiers
- Internal networks not directly accessible from the internet

## 5. API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Implemented to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- Tiered rate limits based on user roles and endpoint sensitivity

### Input Validation
- Strict input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- Protection against injection attacks and malformed requests

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API Authentication
- Short-lived access tokens with regular rotation
- Secure token storage on client-side (HttpOnly cookies for web, secure storage for mobile)

## 6. Database Security

### PostgreSQL Security Measures
- Regular security patches and updates
- Strong authentication and access controls
- Encrypted connections enforced

### MongoDB Security Configuration
- Authentication and authorization enforced
- Network isolation and IP whitelisting
- Encrypted storage and communications

### Redis Security
- Protected mode enabled
- Strong password authentication
- Data persistence encryption

## 7. Secure Development Practices

### Secure Coding Standards
- Enforced through code reviews and automated checks
- Regular security training for development team

### Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST and DAST)
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing

### Dependency Management
- Automated monitoring and updating of dependencies
- Regular security audits of third-party libraries

## 8. Third-Party Integration Security

### Financial Data Aggregation Services
- Secure API integration with providers like Plaid or Yodlee
- Regular audits of data access and storage practices

### Credit Score Services
- Encrypted data transmission
- Minimal data storage, adhering to data minimization principle

### Investment Data Providers
- Secure API keys management
- Regular rotation of access credentials

## 9. Mobile Application Security

### iOS Security Measures
- Data Protection API usage for secure local storage
- Keychain Services for sensitive data storage

### Android Security Measures
- Android Keystore System for secure key storage
- SafetyNet Attestation API to detect device tampering

### Common Mobile Security Features
- Certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Jailbreak/root detection
- Secure local data storage with encryption

## 10. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery

### Incident Response Plan
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities
- Regular drills and updates to the plan

### Security Monitoring and Alerting
- 24/7 monitoring of security events
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities

### Disaster Recovery Procedures
- Regular backups with encryption
- Geographically distributed redundancy
- Documented and tested recovery processes

## 11. Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- GDPR compliance for data protection
- CCPA compliance for California residents
- PSD2 compliance for payment services (if applicable)

### Security Audits
- Annual third-party security audits
- Regular internal security assessments

### Penetration Testing
- Bi-annual penetration testing by external security firms
- Continuous automated vulnerability scanning

## 12. User Data Privacy

### Data Anonymization
- Personal data anonymized for analytics and reporting
- Data minimization principle applied throughout the system

### User Consent Management
- Granular controls for users to manage their data sharing preferences
- Clear and transparent privacy policy

### Data Retention Policies
- Defined retention periods for different data types
- Secure data deletion procedures

## 13. Security Training and Awareness

### Development Team Training
- Regular security awareness training
- Secure coding practices workshops

### User-Facing Security Features
- In-app security center with best practices and tips
- Regular security notifications and updates for users

## 14. Conclusion

The security measures outlined in this document form a comprehensive approach to protecting the Mint Replica application and its users' financial data. By implementing these security controls and continuously improving our security posture, we aim to maintain the highest standards of data protection and user trust.

Regular reviews and updates to this security architecture will be conducted to address emerging threats and incorporate new security technologies and best practices.
