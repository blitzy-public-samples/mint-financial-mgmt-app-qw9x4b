## 1. Introduction

Monitoring is a critical aspect of maintaining the health, performance, and security of the Mint Replica application. This document provides comprehensive guidelines and best practices for monitoring the various components of the system to ensure its reliability and optimal performance.

Effective monitoring allows us to:
- Detect and respond to issues proactively
- Ensure high availability and performance of the application
- Identify trends and potential bottlenecks
- Maintain security and compliance standards
- Make data-driven decisions for system improvements

## 2. Monitoring Infrastructure

### 2.1 Monitoring Tools

The Mint Replica application utilizes a combination of monitoring tools to provide comprehensive coverage:

1. Prometheus: For metrics collection and storage
2. Grafana: For metrics visualization and dashboarding
3. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log aggregation and analysis
4. AWS CloudWatch: For AWS-specific resource monitoring
5. Google Cloud Monitoring: For GCP-specific resource monitoring (if applicable)

### 2.2 Metrics Collection

Metrics are collected from various components of the application:

- Backend servers: Node.js/Express metrics using prom-client
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis exporters
- API Gateway: Built-in metrics from AWS API Gateway or Google Cloud Endpoints
- Kubernetes clusters: kube-state-metrics and node-exporter
- Custom application metrics: Implemented using Prometheus client libraries

### 2.3 Log Aggregation

Centralized log collection and analysis are crucial for troubleshooting and security monitoring:

- Use Filebeat or Fluentd to collect logs from all application components
- Ship logs to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage
- Use Kibana for log visualization and analysis
- Implement log rotation and retention policies to manage storage efficiently

## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Monitor the following critical KPIs:

1. Response times (by endpoint and overall)
2. Error rates (4xx and 5xx errors)
3. Request throughput
4. CPU and memory utilization
5. Database query performance
6. API Gateway latency
7. Financial transaction success rates
8. User engagement metrics (active users, session duration)
9. Mobile app crash rates
10. Third-party API integration performance

## 4. Application Monitoring

### 4.1 Backend Services

Monitor Node.js/Express backend services:

- CPU usage and memory consumption
- Event loop lag
- Active handles and requests
- HTTP request/response metrics (status codes, latency)
- Custom business metrics (e.g., number of financial transactions processed)

### 4.2 Frontend Performance

Monitor React web and React Native mobile app performance:

- Page load times and Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Client-side errors and exceptions
- API call performance from the client perspective
- User interactions and navigation flows
- Mobile app launch time and frame rate

### 4.3 API Gateway

Monitor the API Gateway:

- Request rates and latency
- Error rates and types
- Cache hit ratios (if caching is implemented)
- Throttling and quota usage

## 5. Database Monitoring

### 5.1 PostgreSQL Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor for PostgreSQL:

- Connection counts and utilization
- Query execution times and slow queries
- Index usage and table scans
- Buffer cache hit ratio
- WAL (Write-Ahead Log) generation rate
- Replication lag (if using replication)

### 5.2 MongoDB Monitoring

Important MongoDB metrics:

- Operation counts (inserts, updates, deletes, queries)
- Read and write queue lengths
- Document access patterns
- Index usage statistics
- Replication lag and oplog window
- Connection counts and utilization

### 5.3 Redis Monitoring

Critical Redis metrics to track:

- Memory usage and fragmentation ratio
- Keyspace hits and misses
- Eviction rates
- Connected clients
- Commands processed per second
- Latency statistics

## 6. External Service Monitoring

Monitor integrations with external services:

- API call latency and error rates
- Rate limit usage and throttling events
- Data freshness and synchronization status
- Service availability and uptime

Key external services to monitor:
- Financial data aggregation services (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee)
- Credit score services
- Investment data providers

## 7. Security Monitoring

Implement comprehensive security monitoring:

- Failed login attempts and brute force detection
- Unusual account activities or access patterns
- Potential data breaches or unauthorized access attempts
- SSL/TLS certificate expiration and configuration
- Dependency vulnerability alerts
- Infrastructure and container security scans

## 8. Alerting and Incident Response

### 8.1 Alert Configuration

Set up alerts based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection:

- Use Prometheus Alertmanager for metric-based alerts
- Configure log-based alerts in Elasticsearch/Kibana
- Implement multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, Slack)
- Define severity levels and escalation paths

### 8.2 On-Call Rotations

Establish and manage on-call schedules:

- Use a tool like PagerDuty or OpsGenie for on-call management
- Define primary and secondary on-call responders
- Ensure proper handoffs between shifts
- Provide clear escalation procedures

### 8.3 Incident Response Procedures

Develop step-by-step guides for responding to different types of incidents:

- High-severity incidents (e.g., service outages, data breaches)
- Performance degradation issues
- Security incidents
- Data integrity problems

Include procedures for:
- Initial assessment and triage
- Communication protocols (internal and external)
- Mitigation steps
- Post-incident analysis and reporting

## 9. Performance Optimization

Use monitoring data to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks:

- Regularly review slow queries and optimize database performance
- Analyze API endpoint performance and optimize high-latency calls
- Monitor and optimize caching strategies
- Conduct periodic load testing to identify scaling issues

## 10. Compliance Monitoring

Ensure monitoring covers compliance requirements:

- Implement audit logging for all sensitive operations
- Monitor data access patterns for potential privacy violations
- Track and report on financial transaction accuracy and completeness
- Ensure data retention policies are enforced

## 11. Dashboards and Reporting

Create and maintain monitoring dashboards:

- Develop role-specific dashboards (e.g., operations, development, executive)
- Include key metrics, SLAs, and trend analysis
- Set up automated performance reports for stakeholders
- Use Grafana for real-time dashboards and Kibana for log-based visualizations

## 12. Monitoring System Maintenance

Guidelines for maintaining the monitoring infrastructure:

- Regularly update monitoring tools and agents
- Review and adjust alert thresholds periodically
- Manage the lifecycle of monitoring data (retention, archiving)
- Conduct periodic audits of monitoring coverage
- Keep documentation up-to-date with changes to the monitoring setup
