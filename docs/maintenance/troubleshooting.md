6. Apply fixes: Implement the recommended solutions step by step.
7. Verify the solution: Ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
8. Document the resolution: Update relevant documentation or create a knowledge base article.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication and Authorization Issues

1. Login problems:
   - Verify user credentials in the database.
   - Check for any recent changes in the authentication service.
   - Ensure the JWT secret is correctly set in the environment variables.

2. Token expiration:
   - Verify the token expiration time in the auth configuration.
   - Check if the client is properly refreshing the token before expiration.

3. Permission-related issues:
   - Review the user's role and permissions in the database.
   - Ensure the correct middleware is applied to protected routes.

### Performance Problems

1. Slow API responses:
   - Check database query performance and optimize if necessary.
   - Verify Redis caching is working correctly.
   - Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for bottlenecks.

2. High memory usage:
   - Look for memory leaks in the Node.js application using tools like `heapdump`.
   - Optimize database queries and implement proper indexing.

3. Slow frontend loading:
   - Analyze bundle size and implement code splitting if necessary.
   - Verify CDN configuration for static assets.

### Data Synchronization Errors

1. Failed account synchronization:
   - Check the logs for any errors in the Plaid service integration.
   - Verify the user's access token for the financial institution is valid.
   - Ensure the database can handle the incoming data volume.

2. Inconsistent transaction data:
   - Verify the data transformation process in the `transaction.service.ts` file.
   - Check for any duplicate transaction prevention mechanisms.

### API Integration Failures

1. Credit score service errors:
   - Verify the API credentials for the credit bureau service.
   - Check for any rate limiting issues or service outages.

2. Investment data provider issues:
   - Ensure the API key for the investment data service is valid and not expired.
   - Verify the data format received matches the expected schema.

## Backend Troubleshooting

### Node.js/Express Server Issues

1. Server crashes:
   - Check the PM2 or Docker logs for any unhandled exceptions.
   - Verify all required environment variables are set correctly.
   - Ensure proper error handling is implemented in all routes and middleware.

2. Memory leaks:
   - Use Node.js profiling tools to identify memory-intensive operations.
   - Check for any circular references or improper closure handling.

### Database Connectivity Problems

1. PostgreSQL connection issues:
   - Verify the database connection string in the environment variables.
   - Check if the database server is running and accessible from the application server.
   - Ensure the database user has the necessary permissions.

2. MongoDB connection problems:
   - Verify the MongoDB URI in the environment variables.
   - Check if the MongoDB server is running and accessible.
   - Ensure proper authentication is configured for the MongoDB user.

### Caching Layer (Redis) Issues

1. Redis connection failures:
   - Verify the Redis connection string in the environment variables.
   - Ensure Redis is running and accessible from the application server.
   - Check Redis memory usage and eviction policies.

2. Cache inconsistencies:
   - Review cache invalidation logic in relevant services.
   - Verify cache TTL (Time To Live) settings are appropriate for each data type.

## Frontend Troubleshooting

### React Web Application Issues

1. Rendering problems:
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors.
   - Verify that all required props are passed to components.
   - Ensure state updates are handled correctly in components.

2. State management errors:
   - Review Redux action creators and reducers for any logic errors.
   - Verify that the Redux store is properly connected to components.

### React Native Mobile App Issues

1. iOS-specific problems:
   - Ensure all required native dependencies are properly linked.
   - Verify iOS permissions are correctly set in the `Info.plist` file.

2. Android-specific issues:
   - Check Android manifest for proper permissions and configurations.
   - Verify that all native modules are correctly linked in `android/app/build.gradle`.

## Infrastructure and Deployment Issues

### Container Orchestration Problems

1. Kubernetes pod failures:
   - Check pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
   - Verify resource limits and requests are set appropriately.
   - Ensure all required ConfigMaps and Secrets are properly mounted.

2. Docker container issues:
   - Review Docker logs using `docker logs <container-id>`.
   - Verify Docker image builds successfully and all dependencies are included.
   - Check for any version conflicts in the `package.json` file.

### Load Balancing and Scaling Issues

1. Uneven load distribution:
   - Verify the load balancer configuration in the Kubernetes ingress or AWS/GCP load balancer.
   - Ensure all backend services are registered correctly with the load balancer.

2. Autoscaling problems:
   - Review the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration.
   - Verify that resource metrics are being collected correctly by Prometheus.

### Networking and Firewall Problems

1. Service-to-service communication issues:
   - Verify network policies allow proper communication between services.
   - Check DNS resolution within the cluster.
   - Ensure proper port configurations in service definitions.

2. External API access problems:
   - Verify outbound internet access is allowed from the cluster.
   - Check for any proxy configurations that may be interfering with API calls.

## Security Incident Response

In case of a potential security breach or unusual account activity:

1. Immediately isolate the affected systems or accounts.
2. Collect and preserve all relevant logs and evidence.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the incident.
4. Follow the incident response plan outlined in the security documentation.
5. Once contained, perform a root cause analysis and implement preventive measures.

## Logging and Monitoring for Troubleshooting

Effective logging and monitoring are crucial for troubleshooting. Refer to the `monitoring.md` document for detailed information on:

- Log aggregation using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Metrics collection with Prometheus and visualization with Grafana
- Setting up alerts and notifications for critical issues

## Third-party Service Integration Troubleshooting

For issues with integrated third-party services:

1. Verify API credentials and access tokens are valid and not expired.
2. Check service status pages for any ongoing outages or maintenance.
3. Review API request and response logs for any error messages or unexpected data.
4. Ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms are in place for API calls.

## Data Integrity and Consistency Issues

To identify and resolve data inconsistencies:

1. Regularly run data validation scripts to check for anomalies.
2. Implement database constraints and validation at the application level.
3. Use database transactions for operations that modify multiple related records.
4. Regularly backup data and test restore procedures to ensure data can be recovered.

## Troubleshooting Tools and Techniques

Familiarize yourself with the following tools for effective troubleshooting:

1. Node.js debugging: Use the built-in debugger or tools like ndb.
2. React DevTools: For inspecting React component hierarchies and state.
3. Redux DevTools: For monitoring Redux state changes and actions.
4. Chrome DevTools: For frontend performance profiling and debugging.
5. Postman: For testing and debugging API endpoints.
6. pgAdmin or MongoDB Compass: For directly querying and inspecting databases.

## Escalation Procedures

If an issue cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting:

1. Document all steps taken and gathered information.
2. Escalate to the appropriate team lead or senior developer.
3. For critical production issues, follow the on-call escalation process.
4. Consider engaging third-party support for vendor-specific issues.

## Preventive Measures

To minimize future issues:

1. Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
2. Conduct regular code reviews and maintain coding standards.
3. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.
4. Keep all dependencies and systems up-to-date with security patches.
5. Regularly review and optimize database queries and indexes.
6. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
