# Mint Replica Deployment Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process for deploying the Mint Replica application to production environments.

## Introduction

The deployment process is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that our Mint Replica application is properly released and made available to users. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the deployment process, covering all necessary steps and considerations.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the deployment process, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Access to necessary deployment tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Valid credentials for all required environments
- Up-to-date codebase in the main branch
- Completed and passed all automated tests
- Approved code reviews for all changes since the last deployment

## Deployment Environments

Mint Replica uses the following deployment environments:

1. Development: Used for ongoing development and initial testing
2. Staging: Mirrors the production environment for final testing and validation
3. Production: The live environment accessed by end-users

Each environment is configured to closely match the others, with appropriate security measures in place.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

Mint Replica utilizes a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process. Our pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and includes the following stages:

1. Code checkout
2. Dependency installation
3. Linting and code style checks
4. Unit testing
5. Integration testing
6. Building artifacts
7. Deploying to the target environment
8. Post-deployment tests

The pipeline is triggered automatically on merges to the main branch and can also be manually initiated for specific deployments.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before initiating a deployment, verify the following:

- [ ] All code changes have been reviewed and approved
- [ ] All automated tests are passing in the CI pipeline
- [ ] The staging environment has been tested and verified
- [ ] Database migration scripts have been reviewed and tested
- [ ] All necessary configuration changes have been documented and applied
- [ ] The team has been notified of the upcoming deployment
- [ ] A rollback plan is in place (see [rollback_procedure.md](rollback_procedure.md))

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Preparation

1. Ensure all required changes are merged into the main branch
2. Create a release branch (e.g., `release-v1.2.3`)
3. Update version numbers in relevant files (e.g., `package.json`)
4. Tag the release in Git (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

### 2. Database Migrations

1. Review and test all database migration scripts
2. Apply migrations to the production database using our migration tool
3. Verify the success of all migrations

### 3. Backend Deployment

1. Build the Node.js backend application
2. Deploy the backend to the production environment using our containerization platform (e.g., Kubernetes)
3. Verify the backend is running and responding to health checks

### 4. Frontend Deployment

1. Build the React web application
2. Deploy the built artifacts to our CDN or static file hosting service
3. Build and deploy the React Native mobile apps to the respective app stores (iOS App Store and Google Play Store)

### 5. Configuration Updates

1. Update environment-specific configurations in our configuration management system
2. Ensure all sensitive information and secrets are properly managed and encrypted

### 6. Service Deployment

1. Deploy any updated microservices to the production environment
2. Verify all services are running and communicating properly

### 7. Machine Learning Model Deployment

1. Deploy updated machine learning models to the production environment
2. Verify model endpoints are accessible and returning expected results

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, perform the following checks:

- [ ] Verify all services are running and healthy
- [ ] Run smoke tests to ensure critical functionality is working
- [ ] Check error logs for any unexpected issues
- [ ] Verify database connections and data integrity
- [ ] Test critical user flows (e.g., login, account linking, transaction categorization)

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Access our monitoring dashboard (e.g., Grafana) to observe system metrics
2. Review application logs in our centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack)
3. Set up alerts for any critical metrics or error rates

For more details on monitoring, refer to [monitoring.md](../maintenance/monitoring.md).

## Rollback Procedure

In case of critical issues post-deployment, follow the rollback procedure outlined in [rollback_procedure.md](rollback_procedure.md).

## Troubleshooting

For common deployment issues and their solutions, refer to [troubleshooting.md](../maintenance/troubleshooting.md). This document includes links to relevant logs and monitoring dashboards.

## Human Tasks

The following tasks require human attention:

- [REQUIRED] Review and validate the deployment steps for accuracy and completeness
- [CRITICAL] Ensure all environment-specific configurations and credentials are properly documented and securely stored
- [REQUIRED] Verify that the CI/CD pipeline configuration matches the documented deployment process

Please assign these tasks to the appropriate team members and ensure they are completed before the next deployment.
