# Rollback Procedure

This document provides step-by-step instructions for rolling back the Mint Replica application to a previous stable version in case of critical issues after deployment.

## 1. Identifying the Need for Rollback

- Critical bugs affecting core functionality
- Severe performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues
- Widespread user complaints or inability to access the service

## 2. Rollback Decision Making Process

1. The on-call engineer identifies a potential critical issue
2. The engineer notifies the development team lead and DevOps lead
3. A quick assessment is performed to determine the severity and impact
4. If deemed necessary, the CTO or designated decision-maker is informed
5. The decision to rollback is made based on the severity, impact, and estimated time to fix
6. Once decided, the rollback process is initiated immediately

## 3. Preparation Steps

1. Notify all relevant team members (development, QA, customer support)
2. Prepare a brief message for users explaining the temporary service disruption
3. Ensure access to previous stable versions of all components (application code, database schemas, infrastructure configurations)
4. Verify the availability of recent database backups
5. Check that all necessary credentials and access rights are in place for the rollback process

## 4. Database Rollback Procedure

### PostgreSQL Rollback

1. Stop the application servers to prevent new writes
2. Create a backup of the current database state
3. Restore the most recent backup from before the problematic deployment:
   ```
   pg_restore -d mint_replica_db /path/to/backup_file
   ```
4. Verify the restored data for integrity and consistency

### MongoDB Rollback

1. Stop the application servers to prevent new writes
2. Create a backup of the current database state
3. Restore the most recent backup from before the problematic deployment:
   ```
   mongorestore --db mint_replica_db /path/to/backup_directory
   ```
4. Verify the restored data for integrity and consistency

## 5. Application Rollback Procedure

### Backend Rollback

1. Identify the last stable version tag or commit hash
2. Check out the stable version in the repository:
   ```
   git checkout <stable_version_tag>
   ```
3. Rebuild the application:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. Update the Docker image with the stable version:
   ```
   docker build -t mint-replica-backend:stable .
   ```
5. Push the updated image to the container registry

### Frontend Rollback

1. Identify the last stable version tag or commit hash
2. Check out the stable version in the repository:
   ```
   git checkout <stable_version_tag>
   ```
3. Rebuild the application:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
4. Update the Docker image with the stable version:
   ```
   docker build -t mint-replica-frontend:stable .
   ```
5. Push the updated image to the container registry

### Mobile App Rollback

1. Revert to the last stable version in the app stores (iOS App Store and Google Play Store)
2. If possible, force an update for all users to the stable version

## 6. Infrastructure Rollback

### Terraform Rollback

1. Identify the last stable Terraform state
2. Revert to the stable version of Terraform configurations:
   ```
   git checkout <stable_terraform_commit>
   ```
3. Apply the stable Terraform configuration:
   ```
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

### Kubernetes Rollback

1. Rollback deployments to the previous stable version:
   ```
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend-deployment
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/frontend-deployment
   ```
2. Verify that the rollback was successful:
   ```
   kubectl rollout status deployment/backend-deployment
   kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend-deployment
   ```

## 7. Verification and Testing

1. Perform smoke tests on all critical functionalities
2. Check application logs for any errors or warnings
3. Monitor system performance and resource utilization
4. Verify data integrity and consistency across all services
5. Test integrations with external services (e.g., Plaid, credit score providers)
6. Conduct a brief user acceptance test with a small group of internal users

## 8. Post-Rollback Actions

1. Update status pages or notify users that the service has been restored
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of the root cause of the issue
3. Document the incident, including timeline, impact, and resolution steps
4. Schedule a post-mortem meeting with all relevant team members
5. Update runbooks and deployment procedures based on lessons learned
6. Create tickets for any technical debt or improvements identified during the process

## 9. Rollback Failure Contingency

In case the rollback process itself fails:

1. Immediately halt the rollback process
2. Assess the current state of the system and identify any partially rolled back components
3. Attempt to stabilize the system in its current state
4. If stabilization is not possible, consider a full system restore from the last known good backup
5. Engage additional support from the development and infrastructure teams
6. Consider engaging external support or consultants if necessary
7. Keep stakeholders informed of the situation and expected resolution time

## 10. Documentation and Reporting

1. Maintain a detailed log of all actions taken during the rollback process
2. Create a comprehensive post-mortem report including:
   - Incident timeline
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Actions taken
   - Lessons learned
   - Preventive measures for the future
3. Share the report with relevant stakeholders and team members
4. Update the rollback procedure document with any new insights or improvements

## Conclusion

Having a well-defined rollback procedure is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the Mint Replica application. Regular drills and updates to this procedure will ensure that the team is always prepared to handle critical situations efficiently and effectively. Remember that the primary goal of a rollback is to restore service to a stable state as quickly as possible, minimizing downtime and impact on users.
