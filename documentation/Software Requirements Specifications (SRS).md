This data model represents the core entities and relationships in the Mint Replica application. It uses a combination of relational tables (stored in PostgreSQL) and document-based collections (stored in MongoDB) to optimize for both structured and unstructured data.

### 6.2 Data Storage

The Mint Replica application will implement a robust data storage strategy to ensure data integrity, availability, and scalability:

1. Primary Storage:
   - PostgreSQL: For structured, relational data (e.g., user accounts, transactions, budgets)
   - MongoDB: For semi-structured and unstructured data (e.g., financial insights, user preferences)

2. Data Retention:
   - Active user data: Retained indefinitely while the account is active
   - Inactive user data: Archived after 12 months of inactivity, deleted after 7 years
   - Transaction history: Retained for 7 years to comply with financial regulations

3. Redundancy:
   - Implement multi-region database clusters for both PostgreSQL and MongoDB
   - Use synchronous replication for critical data and asynchronous replication for non-critical data

4. Backup:
   - Perform daily incremental backups and weekly full backups
   - Store backups in a separate cloud storage service (e.g., Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
   - Encrypt backups using AES-256 encryption

5. Recovery:
   - Implement point-in-time recovery for PostgreSQL databases
   - Use MongoDB's native backup and restore capabilities for document-based data
   - Regularly test and validate the recovery process to ensure data integrity

6. Scalability:
   - Implement database sharding for both PostgreSQL and MongoDB to handle large data volumes
   - Use read replicas to distribute read traffic and improve performance
   - Implement a caching layer using Redis to reduce database load for frequently accessed data

### 6.3 Data Processing

The Mint Replica application will implement secure and efficient data processing mechanisms:

1. Data Security:
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
   - Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data (e.g., account numbers, social security numbers)
   - Use tokenization for payment card information to comply with PCI DSS requirements
   - Implement strict access controls and audit logging for all data access

2. Data Flow:

The following diagram illustrates the high-level data flow within the Mint Replica application:

   c. Data Analysis:
      - Process financial data using AI/ML models in the Analytics Service to generate personalized insights
      - Calculate budget progress, goal tracking, and investment performance metrics

   d. Data Presentation:
      - Prepare and format processed data for display in the user interface
      - Generate visualizations and reports based on user preferences

   e. Data Synchronization:
      - Implement real-time data synchronization between the application server and user devices
      - Use WebSocket connections for push notifications and live updates

4. Batch Processing:
   - Implement nightly batch jobs for heavy computational tasks (e.g., generating monthly reports, updating credit scores)
   - Use distributed processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) for large-scale data analysis tasks

5. Real-time Processing:
   - Implement stream processing for real-time transaction categorization and fraud detection
   - Use message queues (e.g., Apache Kafka) to handle high-volume, real-time data streams

6. Data Validation and Cleansing:
   - Implement input validation on all user-submitted data
   - Develop data cleansing processes to handle inconsistencies and errors in financial data from external sources
   - Implement data reconciliation processes to ensure consistency across different data sources

By implementing these data requirements, the Mint Replica application will ensure secure, efficient, and scalable handling of user financial data, providing a robust foundation for the application's features and functionalities.

   - Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure)
   - Library: Socket.io

3. Database Communication:
   - PostgreSQL: 
     - Purpose: Structured data storage and retrieval
     - Port: 5432
     - Connection pooling: Implemented using pg-pool
   - MongoDB:
     - Purpose: Semi-structured and unstructured data storage and retrieval
     - Port: 27017
     - Connection: Mongoose ODM

4. Redis:
   - Purpose: Caching and session management
   - Port: 6379
   - Library: ioredis

5. Message Queue (e.g., Apache Kafka):
   - Purpose: Handling high-volume, real-time data streams
   - Protocol: Kafka protocol
   - Port: 9092

6. OAuth 2.0:
   - Purpose: Authentication and authorization for third-party integrations
   - Flow: Authorization Code flow with PKCE for mobile apps

7. API Gateway:
   - Purpose: Managing and securing API traffic
