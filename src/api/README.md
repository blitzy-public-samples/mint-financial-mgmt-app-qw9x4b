# Mint Replica API

This directory contains the backend API for the Mint Replica application. The API is built using Node.js with Express and provides endpoints for managing user accounts, financial data, budgets, goals, investments, and credit scores.

## Project Structure

- `src/api/index.ts` - Main entry point for the API server
- `src/api/config/` - Configuration files for Express, databases, and other services
- `src/api/routes/` - API route definitions
- `src/api/controllers/` - Request handlers for each route
- `src/api/services/` - Business logic and data processing
- `src/api/models/` - Data models and database schema definitions
- `src/api/middleware/` - Custom middleware functions
- `src/api/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/api/tests/` - API test files

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up environment variables: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values
3. Set up the databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis
4. Run database migrations: `npm run migrate`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with hot-reloading
- `npm run build`: Build the TypeScript files
- `npm start`: Start the production server
- `npm test`: Run the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run migrate`: Run database migrations
- `npm run seed`: Seed the database with sample data

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following main endpoint groups:

- `/auth` - Authentication and authorization
- `/users` - User profile management
- `/accounts` - Financial account management
- `/transactions` - Transaction tracking and categorization
- `/budgets` - Budget creation and tracking
- `/goals` - Financial goal setting and monitoring
- `/investments` - Investment portfolio tracking
- `/credit-score` - Credit score monitoring
- `/insights` - Financial insights and recommendations

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the established coding standards and use ESLint for code linting
2. Write unit tests for new features and ensure all tests pass before submitting pull requests
3. Use meaningful commit messages and follow the git workflow outlined in the project documentation
4. Keep the API documentation up-to-date when adding or modifying endpoints
5. Handle errors consistently using the provided error handling middleware
6. Use environment variables for configuration and sensitive information
7. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints

## Security Considerations

1. Use HTTPS for all communications
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization for protected routes
3. Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
4. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for vulnerabilities
7. Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up database users and API keys

## Deployment

The API is designed to be deployed using Docker and can be scaled horizontally. Refer to the deployment documentation for detailed instructions on deploying the API to production environments.

## Human Tasks

- Review and update API documentation as the project evolves
- Add detailed API endpoint documentation or link to API documentation tool
