# Mint Replica Database Layer

This directory contains the database layer for the Mint Replica application, including configurations, models, and utilities for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

## Database Structure

The application uses a multi-database approach:
- PostgreSQL: For structured data (users, accounts, transactions, budgets, goals)
- MongoDB: For semi-structured data (user preferences, financial insights, investment portfolios, credit scores)
- Redis: For caching and session management

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: Run `npm install` in the project root.
2. Set up environment variables: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required database credentials.
3. Initialize databases: Run `npm run db:init` to set up the database schemas and initial data.

## Key Files and Directories

- `src/database/index.ts`: Main entry point for database connections and models
- `src/database/config/`: Contains configuration files for each database
- `src/database/models/`: Defines data models for PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- `src/database/migrations/`: Database migration scripts
- `src/database/seeders/`: Seed data for development and testing

## Usage

Import the required models and database connections from `src/database/index.ts` in your backend services. Example:

```typescript
import { UserModel, postgresConnection } from '../database';
```

## Development Guidelines

- Always use migrations for schema changes in PostgreSQL
- Use Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections
- Implement proper error handling and connection management
- Write unit tests for database models and queries
- Follow the coding standards outlined in the project's style guide

## Performance Considerations

- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Optimize queries and use aggregation pipelines where appropriate

## Security

- Never store sensitive information (e.g., passwords) in plain text
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper access controls and data validation
- Regularly update database drivers and apply security patches

## Troubleshooting

- Check the application logs for database-related errors
- Verify database connections and credentials
- Use database monitoring tools to identify performance issues
- Consult the project's main documentation for common issues and solutions

## Pending Human Tasks

- Review and update the README content based on the latest project requirements and best practices (Required)
- Add specific instructions for setting up each database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) in development and production environments (Required)
- Include information about database backup and restore procedures (Required)
- Add a section on database monitoring and performance optimization techniques (Optional)
