## Prerequisites

To develop and run the Mint Replica mobile application, you'll need the following software and tools:

- Node.js
- React Native CLI

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `src/mobile` directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. For iOS, run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` to install CocoaPods dependencies

## Running the Application

To run the application on iOS and Android simulators/emulators and physical devices:

### iOS
- Run `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app on the iOS simulator
- To run on a physical device, open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and select your device

### Android
- Run `npx react-native run-android` to start the app on the Android emulator
- To run on a physical device, ensure USB debugging is enabled and run the same command

## Project Structure

The project follows this folder structure:

```
