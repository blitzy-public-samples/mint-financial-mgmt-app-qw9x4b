// This file serves as the main export point for all utility functions used across the Mint Replica application.
// It aggregates and re-exports utility functions from various specialized utility modules.

// TODO: Implement the date-helpers.ts utility file with common date manipulation functions
import * as dateHelpers from './date-helpers';

// TODO: Implement the currency-formatter.ts utility file with functions for formatting currency values
import * as currencyFormatter from './currency-formatter';

// TODO: Implement the validation.ts utility file with common validation functions
import * as validation from './validation';

// TODO: Implement the encryption.ts utility file with encryption and decryption functions
import * as encryption from './encryption';

// Re-export all imported utilities
export {
  dateHelpers,
  currencyFormatter,
  validation,
  encryption
};

// List of human tasks:
/*
 * 1. Implement the date-helpers.ts utility file with common date manipulation functions

This `index.ts` file sets up the structure for importing and re-exporting the utility functions from the four specified modules. It includes TODO comments and a list of human tasks to remind developers that these files need to be implemented.

The file is structured to allow easy importing of all utility functions in other parts of the application. Once the individual utility files are implemented, developers can import utilities like this:

```typescript
import { dateHelpers, currencyFormatter, validation, encryption } from '@shared/utils';
